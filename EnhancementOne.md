## Enhancement One: Software Engineering & Design

**Overview**

The artifact I have chosen to use for my first enhancement, software design and engineering, is a full stack website using the MEAN stack. This application is a travel website for reviewing and booking trips. The site includes a frontend UI, an admin SPA site, a MongoDB Database, and APIs to support data querying, data manipulation and user authentication. I created this project at the end of 2020 for my CS-465 Full Stack Development I course.

I am using this artifact in my ePortfolio to show that I not only understand each individual component, but that I also understand how they all work together. I will also be using this single artifact for each enhancement in the class to showcase how each piece fits together in the stack. For the purpose of this enhancement, I will be enhancing the frontend UI to update additional pages to load data dynamically instead of using static(hardcoded) information. This will show an understanding of HTML, JavaScript, API’s, and Object-Oriented programming. I will do this by modeling objects for each item I want to load dynamically, creating a table for each object and load a record for each, creating API’s to query the database and then updating the pages on the UI to remove the hardcoded HTML and replace with JavaScript.

**Reflection**

I feel like I learned the most through the code review process. If I had not done this in advance of working on the enhancements, I would have hit a lot of blockers, or gotten sidetracked. By having a list of what I wanted to fix in front of me it made my goal easy to identify and work towards. I also outlined the objects I wanted to create in advance, so I was able to work on the front-end pieces and APIs before actually creating the tables and records in the database. I also found it to be much easier to update the project this time around having worked on it in the past. It was familiar so a lot of the changes were easy to find and make. The only challenges I found were having to do all three enhancements in order for my change to be effective.
