## Professional Self Assessment
During my time in the Computer Science program at SNHU I was able to learn a lot of technical skills and techniques that are directly applicable to working in the field.  The first two skills are less technical than the rest, but critical to creating successful real-world applications. These are collaborating in a team environment and communicating with stakeholders. Collaborating in a team environment first requires the ability to provide insightful feedback through peer reviews which I feel confident in having done these in multiple courses. The other skill needed for effectively collaborating in a team environment is understanding how to use different tools such as remote repositories like GitHub and Bitbucket. Having used both throughout my education and getting to apply my knowledge of Bitbucket at my job, I feel confident in the skills I learned.

The remaining skills are more technical and equally critical to being successful in the field of Computer Science. Some of these topics/skills include data structures, algorithms, software engineering, databases and security. Throughout my time at SNHU I have had the opportunity to learn about each of these both at individual levels, as well as more holistically through full stack application development. Some fundamental classes that laid the groundwork for my success in program taught me scripting skills, database querying, system architecture and introduced me to different program languages. Two classes really tied all these different skills together for me personally though. IT315, or Object Orientation Analysis and Design, showed the planning stages of creating a large enterprise application and tied these different skills back to a real business use case. This really helped me understand why we use OOP and how to apply it to my work. The other course was CS465, Full Stack Development I, where we got to apply and object-oriented design to a full stack application and use all the skills we had acquired.

### Project Summary

For my enhancements I chose to use a full stack application I built in my CS-465 course. This application is a travel website for reviewing and booking trips. The application was built using the MEAN stack and includes a frontend UI, an admin SPA site, a MongoDB Database, and APIs to support data querying, data manipulation and user authentication. I completed one or more enhancement in each category to show a more holistic understanding of the code. I will enhance the frontend UI to update additional pages to load data dynamically instead of using static/hardcoded information. This will show an understanding of HTML, JavaScript, APIâ€™s, and Object-Oriented programming. This will also require building new data models for objects, as well as new database tables and queries to support the new functionality.
