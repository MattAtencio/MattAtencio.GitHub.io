# About Me

## Introduction

I started my Computer Science BS degree back in 2010 at University of Maryland College Park. I took a break from school and went to work, taking some classes sporadically and eventually finding a job in application development. I re-enrolled in school full time at Southern New Hampshire University back in January of 2019 and I will be completing my degree in April of 2021.

## Educational Reflection

I think the main thing I have learned since starting my Computer Science degree is how the entire stack of technology works together in development. I think the three most important concepts I have learned are 
 - How to efficiently query, analyze and manipulate data.
 - Viewing coding as more of a way of thinking in most cases, rather than a technical skill. (As well as how it can directly be used to solve business problems)
 - The importance of well documented, thoughtout and organized code and projects. Taking the time to reflect and polish what you have built will help reduce a lot of technical debt in the future.

## Preparing For The Future

I have been working in the financial industry for almost a decade and have held 2 development roles at 2 different companies. In my previous company I mostly did data reporting and some very basic frontend coding because I had limited experience. In my current role I help to troubleshoot and enhance existing full stack applications. By completing my degree, I hope to advance in my career at my current employer. 

My goal is to continue to learn more about application architecture and becoming an enterprise architect who can design applications for organizations. Eventually I would like to design applications that can be used across organizations.

The two main areas I typically find myself most interested in are Data Analysis and DevOps. I think by combining well thought out designs for databases and data warehouses as well as automated pipelines for CI/CD in the cloud you can create an environment where developers can constantly enhance applications, while maintaining stability and reliability for the business users.
