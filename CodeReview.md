## Refinement Plan & Code Review

**Project Selection**

For my enhancements I chose to use a full stack application I built in my CS-465 course. 
This application is a travel website for reviewing and booking trips. The application was 
built using the MEAN stack and includes a frontend UI, an admin SPA site, a MongoDB Database, 
and APIs to support data querying, data manipulation and user authentication. I completed 
one or more enhancement in each category below to my artifact to show a more holistic
understanding of the code. 

**Category One: Software Engineering/Design**

For Software Engineering/Design I chose to enhance the frontend UI to update additional pages to load data dynamically instead of 
using static/hardcoded information. This will show an understanding of HTML, JavaScript, API’s, and Object-Oriented programming. I will do this by 
modeling objects for each item I want to load dynamically, creating a table for each object and load a record for each, creating API’s to query the 
database and then updating the pages on the UI to remove the hardcoded HTML and replace with JavaScript.

**Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structures**

For Algorithms and Data Structures I chose to create new data models and new queries for the APIs to utilize. In my travlr application I created 2 new 
data models for “Blog Posts” and “Testimonials”. I also added queries for basic GET functionality as well as some more targeted queries such as “most recent” 
and “return X number of records”. These changes help to improve the artifact by enabling the home page and the “news” page to load data dynamically.

**Category Three: Databases**

For Databases I chose to create new tables to support the new data models and APIs created in my last enhancement. These changes help to improve 
the artifact by creating more “object” data that can be called and loaded dynamically without code changes.
